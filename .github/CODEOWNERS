# CODEOWNERS
# This file defines code ownership and automatic review assignments
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners
# Owners will be automatically requested for review when someone opens a PR that modifies matching files

# Default owners for everything in the repo
# These users will be requested for review unless a later match takes precedence
